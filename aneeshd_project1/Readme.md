## 8 puzzle problem using BFS

# Instructions to run code
`cd aneeshd_project1`

`python puzzle.py -is <starting_state> -gs <goal_state>`

# Please specify starting and goal states as shown in the following example (without any extra spaces):
# Note that the states are to be given column wise, i.e., the numbers in the [] are columns of the puzzle.
`python puzzle.py -is [1,4,7],[5,0,8],[2,3,6] -gs [1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,0]`

# The files in folder 'solution1' demonstrate going from state
# [1,4,7],[5,0,8],[2,3,6] to state [1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,0].
# The steps needed to solve are shown in the file 'solution1/path.txt'.

# The files in folder 'solution2' demonstrate going from state
# [1,4,7],[5,0,8],[2,3,6] to state [4,0,7],[1,8,6],[5,2,3].
# The steps needed to solve are shown in the file 'solution2/path.txt'.
